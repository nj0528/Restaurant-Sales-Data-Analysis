**Restaurant-Sales-Analysis**

**Introduction**


Cafe Ocean is a beachside restaurant. It wants to improve sales and provide the best possible service to its customers. I will examine the restaurant's food sales data for the year 2020. I'll compile a report to help identify ways to increase food sales and improve productivity.SQL was utilized for analysis, and Power BI Â for visualization. 

**Results**

Total Revenue:$9M <br /> 
Average Order Value:$306M <br /> 
Total number of items sold:62141 <br /> 
Total Orders:32422 <br /> 
Average items per order:1.92 <br /> 

**Recommendation**

The fact that meal orders and revenue peak on weekends, with lower sales during the week, suggests that most customers prefer dining out on weekends. The Ocean Special Shake stands out as the most popular item. To effectively manage the weekend influx, it's essential for the restaurant to ensure that raw supplies are fully stocked in advance. Additionally, to boost sales further, consider offering exclusive weekend discounts, particularly on the Ocean Special Shake, to encourage more purchases.
